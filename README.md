# secan

This is a C++ vector search library currently implementing exact brute-force $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) linear scan across vector datasets using L2 and cosine distance metrics. The project serves as an experimental testbed for CPU and GPU performance optimizations specially on SIMD vectorization, cache-aware data layouts, multi-threading, and eventual support for approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms such as HNSW.

## Build

Building `secan` requires CMake 3.15+ and a C++20-compliant compiler.

```bash
# Configure build
cmake -B build

# Build library, executable, and tests
cmake --build build

# Run test suite
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Usage

`secan` operates on flat contiguous row-major vector datasets and query vectors.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include "secan/search/search.h"

int main() {
    // 3 vectors of dimension 2 (flat row-major layout: N * dim)
    std::vector<float> dataset = {
        1.0f, 2.0f,
        3.0f, 4.0f,
        5.0f, 6.0f
    };
    std::vector<float> query = {3.0f, 4.0f};
    int top_k = 2;

    // Search using "l2" (squared L2) or "cosine" distance
    std::vector<SearchResult> results = linear_scan(dataset, query, top_k, "l2");

    for (const auto &result : results) {
        std::cout << "Index: " << result.index
                  << ", Distance: " << result.distance << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Link against `secan_lib` in your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE secan_lib)
```

## Benchmarks

*Note: Benchmark results will be populated once baseline measurements are established.*

| Dataset Size | Dimensionality | Latency p50 | Latency p95 | Throughput (QPS) | Memory Footprint |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |

## Roadmap

- SIMD-vectorized distance computation
- Cache-aware memory layout
- Multithreaded search
- HNSW as an approximate-search mode
